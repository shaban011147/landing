## Getting Started
In order to get started, make sure you are meeting all requirements listed above.
Then, just go ahead and clone the Gulp Starter.


### `git clone`
To download the Gulp Starter Kit is by cloning this Git repository. 
Before executing any commands, make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your computer.
Then, follow these instructions:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moselaymd-dev/_gulp-starter-mmd.git your-project-name
```
This creates a folder called `your-project-name` (change that to your project name) at the current location where your terminal / command prompt is pointing to.

Then change your working directory to your project folder by executing `cd your-project-name`.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install Gulp Starter.

```bash
npm install
```


## Usage

After use [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) to run the project by writing the following in your terminal, that by default will run the development mode.  
```python
gulp
```

## Modes
We have different modes for each task we do to reduce the Gulp Starter compile time:
- Development mode ( Write Sourcemaps - Error Messages Not Breaking The Build)
- Production mode ( Write headers - Remove Unnecessary CSS - Uglify & Encrypt JS Code - Minify Images)


For production mode run 
```python
gulp --production
```
